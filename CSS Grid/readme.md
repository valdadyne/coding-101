Web development in 2017 means we get to experience new coding techniques that are not only exciting but offer better ways to build on for the 21st Century & beyond. While debate still lingers over what lies in store for the future web development [*see Quora question*](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-web-development-in-2017), one thing is for sure CSS is growing rapidly and as a web developer it is only prudent to utilize the new capabilities to build even more awesome products.


###### What is CSS Grid? [source](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike most frameworks or even the infamous [*flexbox*](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).
You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the **Grid Container**) and to that elements children (which become **Grid Items**).

###### Setting up a Grid

Grid allows us to arrange elements on a page, according to regions created by guides. 

###### Important Terminology

+ **Grid Container** :The element on which display: grid is applied. It's the direct parent of all the grid items.
+ **Grid Items** :The children (e.g. direct descendants) of the grid container.
+ **Grid Lines**: The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical-*column grid lines* or horizontal-*row grid lines* and reside on either side of a row or column.
+ **Grid Track** :The space between two adjacent grid lines. You can think of them like the columns or rows of the grid.
+ **Grid Cell** :The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It's a single "unit" of the grid.
+ **Grid Area** :The total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be comprised of any number of grid cells
